This repository contains a model for comparing two LSTM architectures using hydrological time series data. To run the model, simply open the notebook.ipynb file and execute the cells. The notebook loads all required code from external .py files, including load_data.py, plot_data.py, prepare_data.py, train_and_run_model.py, post_process.py, and models.py. These scripts handle data loading, preparation, model training, and post-processing.

The configuration file, config.yml, is used to manage all customizable parameters. Key settings include model_name, which allows you to select either the "LSTMModel" or "LSTM_combo_Model" architecture, as well as train_dates, where you specify date ranges for training (you can uncomment or add multiple date ranges if needed). Additional parameters include target_station and source_stations for selecting specific station data, dropout_prob for controlling dropout regularization, sequence_length for setting input sequence length, and various training parameters such as num_epochs, batch_size, and learning_rate. You can also control ensemble model runs with num_ensembles and set the plot_start_date and plot_end_date for the visualization range.
